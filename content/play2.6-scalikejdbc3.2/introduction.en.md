## Objective

Hands-on to create a web application using Play2 + ScalikeJDBC.

The main objectives are as follows.

* Scala hands-on
* Try to make a working web application in few hours

Therefore, we will be using the inbuilt functions provided by the framework as much as possible.

## Setup

We will be using the following versions of Scala and Play.

* Play 2.6.x
* ScalikeJDBC 3.2.x

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for conducting this hands-on are as follows.

* Basic knowledge of Java and Web application development
* JDK 1.8 is installed
* The latest version of Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA is installed

## Content

Create a simple application that CRUDs user information.

* Display User list
* Create New User
* Update User information
* Delete User

In the second half, we will also create a JSON-based Web API that performs the same CRUD processing as this application.
