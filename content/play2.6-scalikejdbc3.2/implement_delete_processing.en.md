title: Implement delete method
---

Delete the user of the specified ID from the `USERS` table and redirect to the user list page.

## Controller


As the `Delete` button has already been implemented on the user list page, we will only implement the controller method, being called from `Delete` button.

```scala
def remove(id: Long) = Action { implicit request =>
  DB.localTx { implicit session =>
    //  delete user
    Users.find(id).foreach { user =>
      Users.destroy(user)
    }
    // redirect to user list page
    Redirect(routes.UserController.list)
  }
}
```

Here also, deletion is done using the `Users.destroy ()` method, automatically generated by scalikejdbcGen. If this has to be rewritten with QueryDSL, it will become as following.

```scala
withSQL {
  delete.from(Users).where.eq(Users.column.id, entity.id)
}.update.apply()
```

## Run

Click on the `Delete` button from the user list page and check if user entry has been deleted.
